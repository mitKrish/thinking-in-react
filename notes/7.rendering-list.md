**Where to get your key** 

- Data from a database: If your data is coming from a database, you can use the database keys/IDs, which are unique by nature.
- Locally generated data: If your data is generated and persisted locally (e.g. notes in a note-taking app), use an incrementing counter, crypto.randomUUID() or a package like uuid when creating items.

**Rules of keys** 
- Keys must be unique among siblings. However, it’s okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes in different arrays.
- Keys must not change or that defeats their purpose! Don’t generate them while rendering.
